### 🛠️ Build the Hangman Game

#### Description
Build the classic word-guessing game using Python. Players will guess letters one at a time to reveal a hidden word. After each incorrect guess, they lose one attempt. The game ends when either the word is guessed correctly or the player runs out of attempts.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select words from a predefined list
- Accept letter guesses and display current progress in underscore format (_ _ _)
- Track incorrect guesses and remaining attempts
- End the game when the word is guessed or attempts are exhausted
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with game results
